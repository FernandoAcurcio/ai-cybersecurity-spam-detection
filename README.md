# Supervised Machine Learning for SMS Spam Detection

This repository contains the supporting code, the resultsand the scientific paper  

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to evaluate supervised machine learning techniques for detecting spam SMS messages using a publicly available dataset. The work focuses on reproducible experimentation, model comparison, and appropriate evaluation metrics for imbalanced data.

## Dataset
The experiments use the SMS Spam Collection dataset, publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:  
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/` – Raw and preprocessed SMS spam datasets  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and comparison  
- `results/` – CSV files containing the experimental results reported in the paper  

## Notes
The experiments are implemented in Python using standard machine learning libraries.  
All results reported in the paper can be reproduced using the provided notebooks.
